Scenario 1: Successful Creation of AllProduct

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful creation of an AllProduct. The function should return the newly created AllProduct and nil error.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the repository's Create method to return a new AllProduct and nil error. Prepare an AllProductRequest with valid fields.
  Act: Call the Create method with the prepared AllProductRequest.
  Assert: Assert that the returned error is nil and the returned AllProduct matches the expected AllProduct.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function successfully creates an AllProduct and returns it with no error. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Failed Creation of AllProduct due to Repository Error

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when the repository's Create method returns an error. The function should return an empty AllProduct and the error from the repository.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the repository's Create method to return an empty AllProduct and an error. Prepare an AllProductRequest with valid fields.
  Act: Call the Create method with the prepared AllProductRequest.
  Assert: Assert that the returned error matches the error returned by the repository and the returned AllProduct is empty.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles errors from the repository and returns them to the caller. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when the repository encounters an error.

Scenario 3: AllProduct Creation with Invalid Price

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when the AllProductRequest has an invalid price. The function should return an empty AllProduct and an error.

Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an AllProductRequest with an invalid price.
  Act: Call the Create method with the prepared AllProductRequest.
  Assert: Assert that the returned error indicates an invalid price and the returned AllProduct is empty.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles invalid input and returns an appropriate error. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when given invalid input.

Scenario 4: AllProduct Creation with Empty Fields

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when the AllProductRequest has empty fields. The function should return an empty AllProduct and an error.

Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an AllProductRequest with empty fields.
  Act: Call the Create method with the prepared AllProductRequest.
  Assert: Assert that the returned error indicates that the fields cannot be empty and the returned AllProduct is empty.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles empty input fields and returns an appropriate error. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when given empty input fields.
