================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Error Handling
Issue: The function allProductRequest.Price.Int64() may return an error that is not being handled. Ignoring errors can lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Always handle errors. In this case, you should handle the error returned by allProductRequest.Price.Int64().

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate the input it receives. This could lead to security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the data is used in a context that allows for these types of attacks.
Solution: Always validate input. Consider using a library for this purpose, or write custom validation code that ensures the input meets your expectations.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Creation of a New Product

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the Create function is able to successfully create a new product and add it to the repository.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the repository's Create method to return the same product that it receives as an argument without any error.
    Act: Invoke the Create function with a valid AllProductRequest.
    Assert: Check if the returned product is the same as the one sent in the request and if the returned error is nil.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the returned product is the same as the one sent in the request and if no error is returned. This test is important to ensure that the Create function is able to successfully add a new product to the repository.

Scenario 2: Creation of a New Product with an Invalid Price

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the Create function is able to handle an invalid price in the AllProductRequest.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the repository's Create method to return an error when it receives a product with an invalid price.
    Act: Invoke the Create function with an AllProductRequest that has an invalid price.
    Assert: Check if the returned error is not nil.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if an error is returned when an invalid price is provided. This test is important to ensure that the Create function is able to handle invalid input and return an appropriate error.

Scenario 3: Creation of a New Product When the Repository Returns an Error

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the Create function is able to handle an error returned by the repository's Create method.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the repository's Create method to return an error regardless of the input.
    Act: Invoke the Create function with a valid AllProductRequest.
    Assert: Check if the returned error is not nil.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if an error is returned when the repository's Create method returns an error. This test is important to ensure that the Create function is able to handle errors returned by the repository and propagate them to the caller.
