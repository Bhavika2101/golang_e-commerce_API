================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The error from the `FindByNameProduct` function is not handled, which might lead to exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Use proper error handling to avoid information leakage. For example, instead of `book, _ := s.repository.FindByNameProduct(name_product, price, email_user)`, use `book, err := s.repository.FindByNameProduct(name_product, price, email_user); if err != nil { return nil, err }`

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The `name_product`, `price`, and `email_user` inputs are directly passed to the `FindByNameProduct` function without any sanitization, which might lead to SQL Injection if these inputs are being used in SQL queries.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection attacks. For example, instead of concatenating user inputs directly into the query, use placeholders and pass the inputs as arguments.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful deletion of a product by name

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the successful deletion of a product by its name. The target scenario is when the given product name, price, and email user match with an existing product in the repository.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a mock repository that returns a specific product when the FindByNameProduct method is called and successfully deletes the product when the Delete method is called.
Act: Invoke the DeleteByNameProduct function with the appropriate parameters.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the method returns the deleted product and no error.

Validation:
The assertion is checking if the returned product and error match the expected outcomes. This test is important to ensure that the application can successfully delete a product by its name, which is a basic requirement for managing a product repository.

Scenario 2: Attempt to delete a non-existing product by name

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the scenario where an attempt is made to delete a product that does not exist in the repository. The target scenario is when the given product name, price, and email user do not match with any product in the repository.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a mock repository that returns an error when the FindByNameProduct method is called.
Act: Invoke the DeleteByNameProduct function with the appropriate parameters.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the method returns an error.

Validation:
The assertion is checking if the method returns an error as expected. This test is important to ensure that the application handles the scenario of attempting to delete a non-existing product appropriately, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the product repository.

Scenario 3: Failure to delete an existing product by name

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the scenario where an attempt is made to delete an existing product, but the deletion fails due to some error. The target scenario is when the given product name, price, and email user match with an existing product in the repository, but an error occurs during deletion.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a mock repository that returns a specific product when the FindByNameProduct method is called and returns an error when the Delete method is called.
Act: Invoke the DeleteByNameProduct function with the appropriate parameters.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the method returns an error.

Validation:
The assertion is checking if the method returns an error as expected. This test is important to ensure that the application handles the scenario of a failure to delete an existing product appropriately, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the product repository and for providing accurate feedback to the user.
