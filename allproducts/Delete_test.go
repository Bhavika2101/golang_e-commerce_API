Scenario 1: Delete a valid product

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the Delete function can successfully delete a valid product from the repository.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the repository's FindByID and Delete methods. For FindByID, return a valid AllProduct object and nil for error. For Delete, return the same AllProduct object and nil for error.
    Act: Invoke the Delete function with the ID of the valid AllProduct object.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned AllProduct object and error match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the Delete function when provided with a valid ID. The test is important in ensuring that the function can successfully delete records from the repository.

Scenario 2: Delete an invalid product

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the Delete function handles attempts to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the repository's FindByID method to return an empty AllProduct object and an error indicating that the product does not exist.
    Act: Invoke the Delete function with an invalid ID.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned AllProduct object and error match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the Delete function when provided with an invalid ID. The test is important in ensuring that the function handles error situations gracefully and does not crash the application.

Scenario 3: Error while deleting a product

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the Delete function handles errors that occur while deleting a product from the repository.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the repository's FindByID method to return a valid AllProduct object and nil for error. Mock the Delete method to return an empty AllProduct object and an error indicating that an error occurred during deletion.
    Act: Invoke the Delete function with the ID of the valid AllProduct object.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned AllProduct object and error match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the Delete function when an error occurs during deletion. The test is important in ensuring that the function can handle such errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user.
