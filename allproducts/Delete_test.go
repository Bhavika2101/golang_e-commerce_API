================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Error handling negligence
Issue: The function discards the error returned by FindByID. If this operation fails, the subsequent Delete function will operate on an invalid book object, leading to unpredictable behavior or data corruption.
Solution: Always handle errors returned by functions. In this case, you should check the error returned by FindByID before proceeding to the Delete operation.

Vulnerability: Potential SQL Injection
Issue: The ID parameter is passed directly to the FindByID and Delete functions. If these functions construct SQL queries using string concatenation, this opens the door to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Ensure all user-supplied input is properly sanitized before using it in SQL queries.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing successful deletion of a product by ID

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the Delete function can successfully delete a product from the repository using its ID. It covers the basic functionality of the Delete function.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the repository to return a specific product when the FindByID function is called. Also, mock the Delete function to return the same product and nil error.
    Act: Invoke the Delete function with the ID of the mocked product.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned product matches the mocked product and the error is nil.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the Delete function correctly deletes the product from the repository and returns the correct product. This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of the Delete function is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Testing deletion of a non-existing product

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the Delete function handles the situation when a non-existing product ID is passed. It covers the error handling of the Delete function.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the repository to return an error when the FindByID function is called with a non-existing product ID. 
    Act: Invoke the Delete function with a non-existing product ID.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned product is an empty product and the error is not nil.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the Delete function correctly handles the error when trying to delete a non-existing product. This test is important to ensure the robustness of the Delete function.

Scenario 3: Testing error handling when deleting a product

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the Delete function handles the situation when an error occurs during the deletion process. It covers the error handling of the Delete function.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the repository to return a specific product when the FindByID function is called. Also, mock the Delete function to return an error.
    Act: Invoke the Delete function with the ID of the mocked product.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned product is an empty product and the error is not nil.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the Delete function correctly handles the error when an error occurs during the deletion process. This test is important to ensure the robustness of the Delete function.
