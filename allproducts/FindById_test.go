================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential SQL Injection
Issue: If the FindByID function in the repository constructs SQL queries using string concatenation, it could lead to SQL Injection attacks.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of string concatenation when constructing SQL queries.

Vulnerability: Error Handling
Issue: If the error returned from the FindByID function is not handled properly, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Always handle errors properly. If the error is not nil, return it to the caller function and handle it there.

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Issue: If the ID value is not checked for overflow, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Always check for integer overflow when dealing with integers.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Product ID

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly retrieves a product when a valid ID is provided. The function should return the product associated with the ID and no error.

Execution:
Arrange: Mock the repository method "FindByID" to return a specific product when a particular ID is given. 
Act: Invoke the "FindByID" function with the ID used in the mock setup.
Assert: Assert that the returned product matches the one defined in the mock and that no error is returned.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly retrieves the product from the repository using the provided ID. This test is important to confirm that the function behaves as expected in normal operation.

Scenario 2: Invalid Product ID

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when an invalid ID is provided. The function should return an error indicating that no product was found.

Execution:
Arrange: Mock the repository method "FindByID" to return an error when a specific invalid ID is given.
Act: Invoke the "FindByID" function with the invalid ID used in the mock setup.
Assert: Assert that an error is returned and that the returned product is the zero value of the AllProduct struct.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly handles the case where the repository cannot find a product with the provided ID. This test is important to ensure that the function can gracefully handle error situations.

Scenario 3: Repository Error

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when the repository encounters an error (not related to finding the product). The function should propagate this error to the caller.

Execution:
Arrange: Mock the repository method "FindByID" to return an error regardless of the ID provided.
Act: Invoke the "FindByID" function with any ID.
Assert: Assert that an error is returned and that the returned product is the zero value of the AllProduct struct.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly propagates repository errors. This test is important to ensure that the function doesn't hide or swallow underlying errors, which could make debugging and error handling more difficult.
