ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=FindByID_4aca982a3d

Scenario 1: Successful find by ID

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful scenario of the FindByID function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the repository to return a specific AllProduct when the FindByID method is called with a specific ID.
  Act: Invoke the FindByID function with the specific ID.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned AllProduct matches the one returned by the mock repository.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly returns the AllProduct based on the ID. This is essential as it confirms the function's ability to retrieve a product by its ID.

Scenario 2: ID not found

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the case where the ID does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the repository to return an error when the FindByID method is called with a non-existent ID.
  Act: Invoke the FindByID function with the non-existent ID.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that an error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles errors from the repository. This is important as it confirms the function's robustness in handling non-existent IDs.

Scenario 3: Repository error

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the case where the repository encounters an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the repository to return an error when the FindByID method is called.
  Act: Invoke the FindByID function with any ID.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that an error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly propagates errors from the repository. This is important as it confirms the function's ability to handle repository errors and not mask them.

Scenario 4: Negative ID

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the case where a negative ID is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as this is an invalid operation.
  Act: Invoke the FindByID function with a negative ID.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that an error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles invalid inputs. This is important as negative IDs are not valid and the function should not attempt to process them.
