ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=FindByUser_1cd8e1a866

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The function 'FindByUser' may be vulnerable to SQL Injection if 'email_user' is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization. This can lead to unauthorized data access or data manipulation.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Avoid constructing SQL queries using string concatenation with unsanitized input.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function 'FindByUser' does not perform any validation on the 'email_user' input. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the input is not as expected.
Solution: Implement input validation to check 'email_user' before using it. This could include checks for null values, correct email format, or length restrictions.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of all products by user email

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check that the function successfully retrieves all the products for a given user email. The user email is valid and there are products associated with the user in the repository.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the 'FindByUser' method of the repository to return a slice of 'AllProduct' and nil as error when called with a specific user email.
    Act: Invoke 'FindByUser' on 'service' with the specific user email.
    Assert: Use 'reflect.DeepEqual' to compare the actual result with the expected result. Check that the error returned is nil.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the output of the function matches the expected output, which is the slice of 'AllProduct' returned by the mock. This test ensures that the function correctly retrieves products associated with a user email from the repository.

Scenario 2: User email not found in the repository

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check that the function handles the case where the provided user email does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the 'FindByUser' method of the repository to return nil and an error when called with a specific user email.
    Act: Invoke 'FindByUser' on 'service' with the specific user email.
    Assert: Check that the returned slice of 'AllProduct' is nil and that the error is not nil.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly handles the case where the user email does not exist in the repository. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when provided with an invalid user email.

Scenario 3: Error occurred while retrieving products from the repository

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check that the function handles the case where an error occurs while retrieving products from the repository.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the 'FindByUser' method of the repository to return nil and an error when called with any user email.
    Act: Invoke 'FindByUser' on 'service' with any user email.
    Assert: Check that the returned slice of 'AllProduct' is nil and that the error is not nil.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly handles an error from the repository. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle unexpected errors during execution.

Scenario 4: No products associated with the user email

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check that the function handles the case where there are no products associated with the provided user email.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the 'FindByUser' method of the repository to return an empty slice of 'AllProduct' and nil as error when called with a specific user email.
    Act: Invoke 'FindByUser' on 'service' with the specific user email.
    Assert: Check that the returned slice of 'AllProduct' is empty and that the error is nil.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly handles the case where there are no products associated with the user email. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when there are no products associated with the provided user email.
