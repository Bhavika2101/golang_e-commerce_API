Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of products by user email

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function FindByUser correctly retrieves all products associated with a given user's email. The target scenario is when the user email exists in the repository and has associated products.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock repository with a set of AllProduct entries, some of which are associated with the email to test.
  Act: Invoke FindByUser with the chosen email.
  Assert: Check that the returned slice of AllProduct matches the entries associated with the email in the mock repository.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly filters products by user email. This is crucial for user-specific product retrieval in the application.

Scenario 2: User email with no associated products

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles the case where the provided user email has no associated products. The target scenario is when the user email exists in the repository but has no products.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock repository with a set of AllProduct entries, none of which are associated with the email to test.
  Act: Invoke FindByUser with the chosen email.
  Assert: Check that the returned slice of AllProduct is empty.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles the case where a user has no associated products, returning an empty slice instead of an error. This is important for ensuring graceful handling of valid but unpopulated user emails.

Scenario 3: Non-existent user email

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles the case where the provided user email does not exist in the repository. The target scenario is when the user email is not present in the repository.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock repository with a set of AllProduct entries, all associated with emails different from the one to test.
  Act: Invoke FindByUser with the chosen email.
  Assert: Check that the returned error indicates that the user email was not found.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly returns an error when the user email is not present in the repository. This is important for providing appropriate feedback to the caller about the non-existence of the given user email.

Scenario 4: Repository returning an error

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles an error returned by the repository. The target scenario is when there's a problem with the repository, such as a database connectivity issue.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock repository that returns an error when FindByUser is called.
  Act: Invoke FindByUser with any email.
  Assert: Check that the returned error is the one provided by the mock repository.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly propagates errors from the repository. This is important for diagnosing and handling issues with the underlying data storage.
