Scenario 1: Testing the successful creation of a new service with a valid repository

Details:
Description: This test is designed to check whether a new service is correctly created when a valid repository is provided. The functionality under test is the ability to create a new service using the NewService function.

Execution:
Arrange: A mock repository will be created that implements the Repository interface.
Act: The NewService function will be called with the mock repository as a parameter.
Assert: The outcome will be asserted to ensure that the returned service is not nil and that it contains the provided repository.

Validation:
The assertion verifies that the service is correctly created and contains the provided repository. This test is important as it ensures that the service can be correctly initialized, which is a fundamental requirement for the application to function as expected.

Scenario 2: Testing the creation of a new service with a nil repository

Details:
Description: This test is designed to check the behavior of the NewService function when a nil repository is provided. The functionality under test is the ability to handle invalid input gracefully.

Execution:
Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this test scenario.
Act: The NewService function will be called with nil as a parameter.
Assert: The outcome will be asserted to ensure that the returned service is not nil and that its repository is nil.

Validation:
The assertion verifies that the service is correctly created even when the repository is nil. This test is crucial as it ensures that the NewService function handles invalid input gracefully, preventing potential panics or crashes in the application.

Scenario 3: Testing the creation of multiple services with the same repository

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check whether multiple services can share the same repository. The functionality under test is the ability to reuse repositories across multiple service instances.

Execution:
Arrange: A mock repository will be created that implements the Repository interface.
Act: The NewService function will be called multiple times with the same repository as a parameter.
Assert: The outcome will be asserted to ensure that each returned service is not nil and that they all contain the provided repository.

Validation:
The assertion verifies that multiple services can share the same repository, which is useful in scenarios where resource optimization is necessary. This test is important as it ensures that the application can function correctly and efficiently in resource-constrained environments.
