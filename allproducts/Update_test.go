================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Error Handling
Issue: Ignoring errors from FindByID and Int64 functions, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or runtime panic
Solution: Always handle errors, never ignore them. If an error is not expected to occur and is not critical, it can be logged for later debugging.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: Potential lack of input validation for allProductRequest fields, which could lead to SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize inputs before using them. Use a library like govalidator or create a validation function.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Product Update

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the Update function can successfully update a product with valid parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the repository to return a specific product when FindByID is called and to update the product when Update is called.
  Act: Invoke the Update function with a valid product ID and AllProductRequest.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned product has been updated as expected and no error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the returned product matches the updated product. This test is important to ensure that the Update function correctly updates a product in the repository.

Scenario 2: Product Not Found

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the Update function handles a situation where the product to be updated does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the repository to return an error when FindByID is called.
  Act: Invoke the Update function with a non-existing product ID and AllProductRequest.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that an error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if an error is returned when trying to update a non-existing product. This test is important to ensure that the Update function correctly handles errors when trying to find a product.

Scenario 3: Failed to Update Product

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the Update function handles a situation where the product update fails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the repository to return a specific product when FindByID is called and to return an error when Update is called.
  Act: Invoke the Update function with a valid product ID and AllProductRequest.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that an error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if an error is returned when trying to update a product. This test is important to ensure that the Update function correctly handles errors during the update process.

Scenario 4: Invalid Price

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the Update function handles a situation where the provided price is not a valid number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the repository to return a specific product when FindByID is called.
  Act: Invoke the Update function with a valid product ID and AllProductRequest that includes an invalid price.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that an error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if an error is returned when trying to update a product with an invalid price. This test is important to ensure that the Update function correctly handles invalid input parameters.

Scenario 5: Update with Empty Fields

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the Update function can successfully update a product with some fields left empty in the AllProductRequest.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the repository to return a specific product when FindByID is called and to update the product when Update is called.
  Act: Invoke the Update function with a valid product ID and AllProductRequest, leaving some fields empty.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned product has been updated as expected and no error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the returned product matches the updated product. This test is important to ensure that the Update function correctly handles update requests with some fields left empty.
