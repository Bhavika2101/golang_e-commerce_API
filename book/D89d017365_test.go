func TestNewServiceNegative(t *testing.T) {
	// Since the NewService does not return any errors and only constructs a service instance,
	// there is no obvious negative test case. A negative test case might involve an invalid repository
	// but given that our interface does not provide for this, we cannot write a meaningful negative test case.

	// As a demonstration of what you might do if the constructor could fail:
	/*
	mockRepo := &InvalidMockRepository{} // Constructing an invalid mock repository that should cause failure
	service := NewService(mockRepo)
	if service != nil || err == nil {
		t.Error("NewService did not return an error with an invalid repository, expected failure")
	}
	*/
	// However, this won't compile in this case because NewService cannot actually fail.
